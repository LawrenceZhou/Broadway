This project is designed to simulate the process of selling tickets, and we set that the location is Broadway.
It succeeds to complete the tasks as below:
1.Broadway is going to sell 100 tickets (including 50 unreserved tickets and 50 reserved tickets) in 3 booths;
2.Broadway first let 3 booths sell 50 unreserved tickets;
3.Use random to simulate the process of a customer choosing a booth;
4.When the unreserved tickets are 10 left, Broadway starts to add 50 reserved tickets to sell, with re-adding the tickets and selling tickets simultaneously;
5.Use random to simulate the rest of ticket seller, each ticket seller should rest at least twice;
6.Display the number of tickets left as selling.
